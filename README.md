# External asset management in Sitecore
External Asset Management in Sitecore is an open source module guiding you about how to plug an external asset library into Sitecore. Its implementation assumes that the external asset library is based on [Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/Welcome.html) and shows all nuances in that regard.
If you plan integrating with any other external system then the general approach will remain the same.
